2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock clk/inst/clk_in is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk_pin and clk_250_clk0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sys_clk_pin] -to [get_clocks clk_250_clk0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk_pin and clk_250_clk0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sys_clk_pin] -to [get_clocks clk_250_clk0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock clk/inst/clk_in is created on an inappropriate internal pin clk/inst/clk_in. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_in_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): clk/clk_in, clk_in_IBUF_inst/O, por_counter_reg[0]/C, por_counter_reg[1]/C,
por_counter_reg[2]/C, por_counter_reg[2]_replica/C, por_counter_reg[3]/C,
por_counter_reg[4]/C, por_counter_reg[4]_replica/C, por_counter_reg[5]/C,
por_counter_reg[6]/C, por_counter_reg[7]/C, por_counter_reg[8]/C

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -hier -include_replicated_objects -filter {NAME =~ *temp_mon_enabled.u_tempmon/device_temp_sync_r1_reg[*]/D}]' of constraint 'set_max_delay' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '6' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
